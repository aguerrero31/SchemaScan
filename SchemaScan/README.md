# SchemaScan
 A schematic pdf parser written primarily in C++. Contains (or will contain) a library (SchemaScanLib), a Console Application (SchemaScanConsole), and a GUI Application (SchemaScanApp). This was created to aid in searching electronics schematics for specific parts (or whatever you want, really). Technically this can be used to search whatever .pdf files you would like.

# SchemaScan
 An Electronics Schematic (.pdf) parser written primarily in C++. Contains (or will contain) a library (SchemaScanLib), a Console Application (SchemaScanConsole), and a GUI Application (SchemaScan). This was created to aid in searching electronics schematics for specific parts (or whatever you want, really).

 Currently the GUI app is/will be Windows only, but I have plans for Linux/Mac in the future. The Console Application should be suitable for Linux and Mac at the moment

 Library Requirements:
 - PoDoFo
 - hashlib2plus
